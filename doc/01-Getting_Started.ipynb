    "The `cibin` package provides a method for constructing exact confidence intervals based on the method in section 3 of [\"Exact confidence intervals for the average\n",
    "causal effect on a binary outcome\" by Li and Ding](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.6764). This method \n",
    "inverts a series of randomization tests. With sample size *n*, the approach requires performing O(*n*$^4$) randomization tests, justifing computationally efficient methods of finding exact confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theroem 2(1) in Li and Ding provides useful order information to reduce the number of randomization tests, resulting in at most *O(n$^2$)* randomization tests needing to be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper provides technical details and R code, but the `cibin` code base is a python implementation of the method. "
