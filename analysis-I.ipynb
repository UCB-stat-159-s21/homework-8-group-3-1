The lower bound is postive, and the lower bound for method 3 is negative and the upper bound is larger for sterne is larger than the upper bound of method 3. The conclusion might be that the treatment effect might not have such good performance if we use method 3 to retrive to result, which means the press might assume the result to be overestimate."

And it is not reasonable to have extreme value such as 1 and -1 in 95% confidence intervals. The average effect should be zero to fulfill the null hypothesis."
