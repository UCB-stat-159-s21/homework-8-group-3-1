    '''
    Find 2-sided 1âˆ’alpha confidence bounds for the average treatment effect.

    Assuming a randomized experiment with binary outcomes and two treatments,
    (active and control), finds the confidence bounds for tau, the average
    treatment effect.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n11 : int
        number of subjects assigned to treatment 1 who had outcome 1
    n10 : int
        number of subjects assigned to treatment 1 who had outcome 0
    n01 : int
        number of subjects assigned to treatment 0 who had outcome 1
    n00 : int
        number of subjects assigned to treatment 0 who had outcome 0
    alpha : float in (0, 1)
        The desired type 1 error level.
    exact: boolean
        Whether to compute exact result. If true, sampling distributions are
        computed by enumerating all possible samples. If false, simulations
        are used to approximate the sampling distribution.
    max_combinations: int
        Maximum amount of combinations to sample per table if exact=True
    reps: int
        Number of samples to generate if exact=False

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple of 3 items:
        [lb, ub]: lower/upper bound of the confidence interval,
        [allocation that gives lb, allocation that gives ub],
